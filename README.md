# Build the Docker Image
# Once youâ€™ve created the Dockerfile, navigate to the project directory and build the Docker image using the following command:
docker build -t anbarasu-a-n-portfolio .

# Run the Docker Container
docker run -p 8080:80 anbarasu-a-n-portfolio





# Push the image to Hub
# Verify the image name and tag: The image name should follow this format:
docker tag <local-image-name> <username>/<repository-name>:<tag>

# Example
# Ensure the name of the image matches exactly as you are trying to push. In your case:
docker tag anbarasu-a-n-portfolio anbarasuan/anbarasu_a_n-portfolio:latest

# Push the image to Docker Hub: Once tagged correctly, try pushing the image:
docker push anbarasuan/anbarasu_a_n-portfolio:latest
